A survey by the National Safety Council shares that 66 percent of drivers make phone calls while driving in the parking areas. This significantly increases the probability of hit-and-run cases.Dashcam with parking mode works even when your car is parked, so you can do everything freely while cam keep an eye on every happening near your car. These can be extremely helpful in making accident claims or finding intruders.</p><h2 tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Heading2" class="sc-dPiLbb JgHoc pf-17_">What are Different Parking Mode Types </h2><p class="sc-bBHHxi fhourC pf-19_" tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Paragraph3">It’s vital to know various parking modes before installing any dashcam with parking mode;</p><h3 tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Heading2" class="sc-dPiLbb JgHoc pf-21_">Simple Parking Mode</h3><p class="sc-bBHHxi fhourC pf-23_" tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Paragraph3">It starts recording the footage only when there is some motion, making it the most energy-efficient option. However, the camera takes some time to start, so the culprit might already have left before your camera could record them.</p><h3 tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Heading2" class="sc-dPiLbb JgHoc pf-25_">Buffered Parking Mode</h3><p class="sc-bBHHxi fhourC pf-27_" tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Paragraph3">The buffered parking mode is always up and running, saving the footage to internal memory. Upon detecting motion, the camera starts recording the footage 10 seconds before the event and continues to record 20-30 seconds after it has happened. Those clips are secured in a special folder, so they aren't overwritten.</p><h3 tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Heading2" class="sc-dPiLbb JgHoc pf-29_">Time-lapse Parking Mode</h3><p class="sc-bBHHxi fhourC pf-31_" tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Paragraph3">The time-lapse parking mode records still images every second to create time-lapse footage you can watch later. Some time-lapse dashcams also switch to normal recording if they detect an event. </p><h2 tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Heading2" class="sc-dPiLbb JgHoc pf-33_">How to Choose Dashcam with Parking Mode</h2><p class="sc-bBHHxi fhourC pf-35_" tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Paragraph3"><b>Parking Mode Options</b> <br>Dashcams have several recording options, such as simple, time-lapse, and buffered. Pick the one that favors the severity of parking accidents in your area of usage.<br> <br><b>Video Quality &amp; Features</b> 
Choosing as high-quality a camera as possible is always good, preferably 1080p and above. The higher resolution simply means clearer recording.<br> 
<b><br>Field of View <br></b>The camera's field of view tells you how much area it can capture. A wider field of view means more area, but it might also have distorted footage, especially at the edges.
<br><b><br>Storage Capacity</b> <br>Since the dashcam records footage in high quality, it is crucial to have adequate memory card storage. Some dashcams overwrite the older footage to accommodate new ones to avoid manual deletion.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b><br>Power Source</b><br>Dashcams come with different power options, such as a built-in battery and connection to the car's battery. Choose what fits your situation best.

The 8mp front camera has a resolution of 3840×2160@30fps while the rear 3mp camera is 2560×1440@30fps, perfectly capturing the vehicles from behind. Moreover, the G900 has speakers and a microphone providing noise-canceled audio.<br><br><b>Parking Mode</b>
<br>The G900 offers different parking modes, such as;
<br>●	Loop recording that continues to record while covering the earliest unlocked videos.

<br>●	Continuous time-lapse video recording.<br>Moreover, the G-sensor detects a collision, and the cam starts recording the video and locks it as evidence.<br> <br><b>Field of View</b><br>The G900 is shaped in a way that fits the vehicle smoothly. As a result, it blocks the rearview mirror and provides a horizontal field of view, which is much better than a 10" or 11" inch screen.<br> 
<br><b>Power Source</b> <br>The built-in battery has been upgraded from traditional lithium to a supercapacitor, which charges faster and is more durable.
