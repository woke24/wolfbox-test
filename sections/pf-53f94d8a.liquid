Having evidence of altercations on the road or while parked can make resolving disputes and filing insurance claims a walk in the park. But, like with all electronics, you may experience an issue or two. When your dashcam isn’t working properly, it’s frustrating. But don’t worry, we’re here to help.</p><p class="sc-gIDmLj eMdhGW pf-13_" tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Paragraph3">Usually, dashcam problems are quick and easy to fix. So, let’s go through common issues and simple solutions you can try today. Whether your dashcam won’t turn on, produces low-quality video, or has a number of other problems, we have solutions. And remember, getting a high-quality product from a reputable brand like <a href="https://https://wolfbox.com/" target="_self">WolfBox </a>is the best way to prevent pesky problems from ever occurring in the first place.</p><h2 tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Heading2" class="sc-brSvTw kXcmVH pf-15_">Dashcam Won’t Turn On</h2><p class="sc-gIDmLj eMdhGW pf-17_" tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Paragraph3">Is your car dashcam not turning on? No problem. In most cases, it’s a simple connectivity or power issue. Start by ensuring that the power cable is securely plugged in. Take a moment to examine the cord for any damage or exposed wires. If everything looks fine, try a different cable. Then, try plugging in a different device to determine that the problem is not the cord or dashcam.<br><br>Sometimes, a dashcam that won’t turn on is due to a blown fuse. Look in your car’s manual to see which fuse is responsible for supplying power to the USB port or wherever your dashcam is plugged in. If you notice a blown fuse, carefully switch it out and power on your dashcam.
<br><br>If none of these solutions work, you may need to contact the dashcam company for further assistance.

The main culprit is often an internal problem caused by an ill-formatted memory card. When the wrong SD card is installed, it’s common to notice choppy footage or a frozen screen. So, let’s talk about how to fix it.<br><br>Before you buy a new SD card, try restarting the car dashcam–sometimes, it’s as easy as that. You’ll also want to make sure that the device isn’t overheating due to direct sunlight. Then, check online to see what SD card is recommended for your specific dashcam. You’ll want to replace whatever card that’s installed with the proper one. Using the recommended memory chip will make sure your device is able to function at its maximum potential, avoiding pesky issues like a frozen screen.<br>
</p><h2 tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Heading2" class="sc-brSvTw kXcmVH pf-93_">Poor Video Quality</h2><p class="sc-gIDmLj eMdhGW pf-95_" tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Paragraph3">Capturing razor-sharp footage is crucial for indisputable evidence. So, if your dashcam is recording poor-quality videos, it’s a real problem. Recordings that have blurry sections may be due to a dirty lens. Check the lens of your dashcam and clean it with a microfiber cloth. For extra dirty lenses, a cleaning solution will work wonders.<br><br>If your lens looks squeaky clean, but the recordings are still low-quality, you may just need to adjust the resolution settings. Open up the settings on your device and increase the video resolution. Keep in mind that some dashcams lack high-quality recordings in low-light scenarios. Consider upgrading to a <a href="https://https://wolfbox.com/" target="_self">WolfBox cam</a> to ensure you capture top-notch video day and night.<br>
</p><h2 tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Heading2" class="sc-brSvTw kXcmVH pf-97_">No Wi-Fi</h2><p class="sc-gIDmLj eMdhGW pf-99_" tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Paragraph3">Not able to connect your smartphone to the Wi-Fi of your dashcam? Not to worry. Wi-Fi connectivity issues are usually a walk in the park. Let’s first clarify that the Wi-Fi of your dashcam is different than the Wi-Fi you connect to in your home. You won’t be able to use it to surf the web or watch YouTube videos. Instead, the Wi-Fi is just a way to give you wireless access to the device. Now, let’s look at solutions to connectivity issues.<br><br>First, check that your car dashcam and its Wi-Fi are turned on–you won’t be able to connect to a powered-off device. Then, ensure that you are in the Wi-Fi range. Most devices have a range of around 30 feet. The closer you are to the device, the fewer issues you’ll have. In some cases, you may need to put your smartphone on airplane mode. Switch airplane mode on and then try to connect to the Wi-Fi.<br><br>Sometimes, Wi-Fi issues are caused by the SD card. It’s important to use the recommended SD card to avoid complications. You can also try reformatting the memory card by opening settings, selecting Format, and following the instructions.<br>
</p><h2 tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Heading2" class="sc-brSvTw kXcmVH pf-101_">Footage Not Saving</h2><p class="sc-gIDmLj eMdhGW pf-103_" tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Paragraph3">If your dashcam isn’t saving footage, well then, it defeats the purpose of having a dashcam in the first place. Nine times out of ten, the problem is caused by a memory card that’s not formatted correctly, not powerful enough, or overfull. So, let’s walk through a few solutions to try.<br><br>Dashcams require powerful memory cards, so make sure you’re using a high-quality SD card that’s up for the task. Next, make sure that you have Loop Recording turned on. Loop recording is a feature that records over the oldest footage so that you never have to worry about an overfull SD card. Check that the memory card is properly formatted by opening up settings and following your device’s instructions to reformat it.<br>

A car dashcam made by a reputable company should have minimal issues when it comes to maintaining its position. Low-quality car dashcams tend to be heavier and include poor suction cups. Here are some tips to prevent your dashcam from falling.<br><br>Thoroughly clean the area where you wish to place your dashcam. Use a wet rag and wipe both the surface and the suction cup. Cleaning products with chemicals could leave a residue, so just stick to water. If the suction cup isn’t working, try using adhesive tape or Velcro patches.<br>
</p><h2 tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Heading2" class="sc-brSvTw kXcmVH pf-109_">Final Thoughts</h2><p class="sc-gIDmLj eMdhGW pf-23_" tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Paragraph3">Dashcam problems might not be on your favorite-things-to-do list, but the good news is that most issues really aren’t a big deal.
