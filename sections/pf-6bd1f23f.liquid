These small devices continuously record video footage of your journey, capturing everything from scenic drives to unexpected incidents. But what do you do with all that recorded footage? In this guide, we'll explore the ways you can do for dash cam playback and review the footage captured by your car camera.</p><h2 tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Heading2" class="sc-emDsmM BOtMC pf-13_"><br>Where is Dash Cam Footage Stored?</h2><p class="sc-bvFjSx yVjXo pf-15_" tabindex="0" spellcheck="false" data-pf-type="Paragraph3">
<br>Modern dash cams typically use a microSD card to store recorded video footage. These small, high-capacity memory cards can hold a significant amount of data, depending on their storage capacity. The footage is saved in a loop, meaning that when the card is full, the oldest recordings are automatically overwritten by new ones. This loop recording ensures that your dash cam is always ready to capture new events, but it's important to note that if there's a specific video you want to keep, you should save it before it gets overwritten.
